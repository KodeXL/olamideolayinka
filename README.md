## About Me
I am a data professional with expertise in data science, fraud detection, AML policy design, and financial crime analytics. I work with databases, Python, and visualization tools to transform raw data into clear, actionable insights. My experience bridges compliance, fraud prevention, and applied data and machine learning projects.

I have developed interactive dashboards, automated transaction monitoring workflows, and applied statistical analysis to real-world financial data. I am driven by solving problems that safeguard people and organizations, using data as the link between risk and strategy.

## Projects

### 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection (Machine Learning)
Supervised machine learning project identifying fraudulent transactions within a highly imbalanced dataset.
- Processed 284K+ anonymized transactions with PCA-transformed features
- Scaled only Time (RobustScaler) and Amount (StandardScaler) to preserve PCA integrity
- Balanced data using SMOTE oversampling and Random Undersampling to improve minority-class representation
- Trained and evaluated models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree) across imbalanced and balanced datasets
- Observed that accuracy decreased on both balanced experiments compared to the imbalanced dataset — a natural result of reducing the dominance of the majority (non-fraud) class; however, recall and ROC AUC significantly improved, indicating a stronger ability to detect actual fraud
- The Undersampled balanced Logistic Regression and Linear SVC delivered consistently high recall and ROC-AUC without overfitting, making them more reliable for real-world use.
- Visualized and interpreted model performance using ROC and confusion matrices

### 🚀 SpaceX Falcon 9 First-Stage Landing Prediction  
Machine learning project predicting the success of Falcon 9 booster landings using launch and payload data.  
- Collected and cleaned launch data using Python and SQL  
- Performed exploratory data analysis to identify key drivers of landing success  
- Built and compared models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM) with ROC-AUC evaluation  
- Developed interactive Plotly Dash dashboard to visualize launch outcomes by payload, orbit, and site
